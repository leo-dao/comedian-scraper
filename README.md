# comedian-scraper

Web scraper that checks the number of siblings comedians have for an extra 1% on my final grade for PSYC 332 assignment (Intro to Personality). 
Follows pages of comedians from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_comedians and checks if ‘the youngest of *x*’ is written in a paragraph using regex. 
Counts number of siblings and calculates average.
The assignment was to find 50 comedians who are the youngest sibling in their family to test Dr. Leman's theory that youngest siblings are more likely to become comedians.
